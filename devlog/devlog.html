        <u>Initialization and Conceptualization</u>
    </h3>
    <p>
        I have decided to develop my first game! 
        This is exciting but very intimidating. I have never done anything
        like this before and I have no idea how to do it.
        The first logical step was to create a GitHub repository and Project,
        and lay out how the project folder will be organized. 
        This is the layout I am starting with:
    </p>

    <p>
        The concept of the game is extremely simple, it's a clicker game. You are a blacksmith in a fantasy style world.
        A war has broken out, destroying most of your village. Your shop survived and the general of the army
        has commissioned you to provide the soldiers with swords, which will be made with a click.
        The goal of the game is to make as many swords as you can. There will be upgrades available, such as hiring apprentices to
        automatically make swords, and merchants to sell them. To keep it simple, there will only be two items to personally keep
        track of. Swords and gold. Swords are what you make by clicking, and gold is what you get for selling them.
        This should hopefully allow upgrades for the sword's value to be increased, somewhat infinitely.

    <h3>
        <u>Art and Design</u>
    </h3>
    <p>
        I'm going for a pixel art style for this game, and will be designing all the visual elements personally unless I require
        help. I am using the Asperite software to create the sprites. The first thing I think I should design is the anvil,
        which will be the item clicked to make swords. I think I'm going to make all assets on a 32x32 canvas.
    </p>
    <h2>
        1:35pm
    </h2>
    <p>
        I've created the first sprite for the anvil that will be clicked and it's... awful. But just a place holder for now.
    </p>
    <p>
        <img src="/clicker/devlog/devlogassets/first-anvil-sprite.png" alt="Anvil">
    </p>
    <p>
        Let's write down some assets that I'll need to make for this project. This first list will be my no means definiative. Then 
        I'll get started on Godot.
        <ul>
            <li>Anvil Sprite</li>
            <li>Sword Sprite</li>
            <li>Gold Sprite</li>
            <li>Menu Sprite
                <ul>
                    <li>Settings</li>
                    <li>Upgrades</li>
                </ul>
        </li>
        </ul>
    <p>
    Now, let's learn how to use Godot. I'm going to look around for some tutorials and guides.
    </p>
    <h3>4:11pm</h3>
    <p>I've looked through a bunch of content on godot and learned an estremely basic rundown of a clicker game. It's very barebones
        and seems good to work off of. Here's what it looks like:
    </p>
    <p>
        <img src="/clicker/devlog/devlogassets/clicker-prototype1.png" alt="Godot Clicker Game" class="gameScreenshots"> <!--make this image smaller-->
    </p>
    <p>
        I guess next step is having the button look like the anvil:
    </p>
    <p>
        <img src="/clicker/devlog/devlogassets/clicker-anvil-button.png" alt="Godot Clicker Game" class="gameScreenshots">
    </p>
    <p>
        <h3>4:40pm</h3>
    </p>
    <p>
        The button now looks like an anvil! I changed the node from a regular button to a texture button and sent it
        to still send the same signal and it works, I just need to do 2 more things next: Make sure it doesn't blur the image and try
        to shape the actual button to the anvil.
    </p>
    <p>
        Back to the art however, I've come up with a cute sword design that I am really happy with:
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <h2>11:18pm</h2>
    <p>
        I've improved the anvil sprite,
        and made the button the same size as the anvil. The game now looks like
        this:
    </p>
    <p>
        <img src="/clicker/devlog/devlogassets/clickerscreenshot-endofday1.png">
    </p>
    <p>
        I'm now going to design a coin and start to come up with some other 
        important assets to make. And also add a "coins" label to scene.
        Maybe I'll look into looking into a "convert swords for coins" button,
        maybe 5 swords to a coin, I can rebalance it later. This can also be
        upgraded of course.
